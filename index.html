  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I am a second year Graphic Design student studying at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Ontario. My interests include drawing, hiking, running, spending time with my friends and family, listening to music and doing lots of exploring.</p>
  <p>I spent two years at Carleton University studying a major of Psychology with a minor of Neuroscience, and decided to switch to Graphic Design after lots of research into other programs. Graphic Design seemed to be what I was looking for, and it has proven to be an extremely creative and ever-learning field of design. I look forward to completing the next two years and learning everything I need to know to succeed.</p>
